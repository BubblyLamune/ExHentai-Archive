What is ExHentai-Archive?
---

ExHentai-Archive allows the user to mark galleries on E(x)Hentai for download, the downloading is then done through the built in Gallery Archive function of E(x)Hentai.

Then all downloaded galleries can be viewed and searched through in the same way you'd navigate E(x)Hentai.

As long as your local web server is running you can queue any gallery for download with the included userscript adding a button to every gallery thumbnail.

You can even setup scheduled times you'd like to download these galleries through a little scripting. (see setup guides for more information)
